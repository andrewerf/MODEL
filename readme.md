## Build instructions

The library is header-only. Tests and benchmarks are compiled to separate executables.

The most convenient way to get the tests and benchmarks results is to launch all-in-one script `./scripts/build_test_benchmark.sh` from the root of the repo.
The script outputs results of testing and benchmarks. Additionally, if python is installed, it plots the results of the benchmarks.
